## Development Goal
The Development goal was to create a solution for waste on pens the warehouse would use hundreds of pens to write the SKU onto the boxes of stock in order to know what was stored in the boxes this created lots of waste and also lots of cost so the goal was to create a way of printing SKU's on to a sticky label which could then be placed onto the side of the box so that it would elimnate the need for so many pens.
  
## Usage  
   1. Type the number you want to print out onto a label
   2. Chose the printer from the printer list menu
   3. Click print. 
## What could be improved?
There are things that could be improved to make this application better to use for example:
1. Using constraints based upon the label size that you are printing to determine the correct font size.
2. Allow the user to preview the label before printing therefore they know if it will look good enough.
3. Allow the user to change the color of the text they're printing.
4. Instead of having to type the SKU there could be a list to pick the SKU from if the system that booked in stock was advaced enough have a list which would be populated as soon as stock was booked in through barcode show that SKU at the top with a description of the product and maybe even have the list filterable.
